# Malaysian Mineral Resources Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes mineral extraction data from Malaysia, using machine learning to identify patterns and AI to generate insights. The dashboard visualizes production trends, commodity growth rates, and state clustering based on production patterns.

## Features

- Interactive dashboard showing mineral production by type
- Top commodities by production volume
- Growth rates analysis for different commodities
- State clustering based on production patterns
- AI-generated insights using DeepSeek

## Data Sources

The analysis uses three primary datasets:
- `m.csv`: Mineral extraction data across Malaysian states
- `d.csv`: Water quality data (to be implemented)
- `t.csv`: Timber production data (to be implemented)

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, Python, scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, Chart.js, Bootstrap
- **Deployment**: Vercel
